necessary to install react-router-dom every time create a new project ?

npm install react-router-dom 

It is a library used in React to create multiple pages in a single page application SPA without reloading the brouser.

import :---
js keyword to bring code from another file

React :---
default import from React library

{} :---
named import, getting only spacific part of react

'react' :---
name of package/module you're importing from 

React is default react object, useState is function 




if any error like 
'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

delete => node_modules and package-lock.json 
run npm install 
then npm start



clickOutside :---
custom hook that listens to clicks on the whole page/document 
if user click outside of a specific element (ref)
it runs callback function 

to be continued....

useRef ?
what is useRef 
react hook that gives you a way to store a reference to something
DOM element or value that doesn't re-render the component.

const myRef = useRef(initialValue)

myRef.current holds the actual value
it doesnt change when UI updates 
it survives re-renders

DOM access

when to use ?
you want to -
store values across renders without re-rendering
access DOM node_modulesremember previous valuesdetect click outside or focus 


access DOM elements, store mutable values, track previous state, track timers-intervals, scroll positions-animations

useState() tracking or updating UI, want to UI re-render on change, writting full form logic, remember component status
useEffect() fetching async data 



console.log(myRef.current.value) // won't work before render

const inputRef = useRef()
inputRef.current.focus() // error: 'null'
<input ref={inputRef} //atech properly 

never declare inside 
event handlers
useEffect
loops
